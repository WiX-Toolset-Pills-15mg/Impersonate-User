        Step 1: Create a deferred custom action
        ====================================================================================================
        
        Create a deferred custom action as it is shown in the Deferred Custom Action pill:
        - https://github.com/WiX-Toolset-Pills-15mg/Deferred-Custom-Action
        
        Set the "Impersonate" attribute to "no".
        
        ....................................................................................................
        Impersonate="yes"
        The custom action runs without administrative privileges with the credentials of the current user.

        Impersonate="no"
        The custom action is run in System context. When running in system context, the custom action has
        full access to the system.
        
        Default Value: "yes"
        ....................................................................................................
